requirement -- candle graph and state machine

1. Candle graph is not based onQuery(it is always a continuous flow of streaming of real time transactional data) To do so we need a state machine (like kafka) we need to have few topics(publisher and subscriber) the incoming data will be published and subsequently subscribed by consumer

2. topic like buy sell of coins there we need publisher and subscriber (or consumer )

3. table structure id --> all column for order ---> asset ----> coin bps ---> impact coin bps ----> coin value ---> impact coin value ----> share value ---> impact share value

4. impact calculation = previous value - current value if > 0 then increase , if less than 0 then decrease 

5. there is always a base price which will be set at the initial stage by admin or developer.

6. currency table id ---> currency ---> currency country ---> base value in USD ---> unit value

7. transaction fees id --->currency ---> amount start ---> amount end ---> fees ----> unit

8. asset table for unit bps value id ---> asset/symbol ---> icon ---> bps value
